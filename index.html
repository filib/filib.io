  Hello, my name is Philip Cunningham, and this is my blog.
</p>

<p>
  I write about my experiences being a software developer working remotely from
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne">Melbourne, Australia</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I currently work as a Senior Backend Engineer in Secure at GitLab.
